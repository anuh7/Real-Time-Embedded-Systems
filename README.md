# ECEN 5623 Real-Time-Embedded-Systems

## Development Platform
Raspberry Pi 3b+/4 and a Logitech UVC compatible USB camera

## Course Description: 
The course focus is on real-time analysis, design and development theory and practices as well as fundamentals of integrating microprocessor-based embedded system hardware, firmware and software to meet well-specified system requirements for operation within real-time constraints. 

## Topics covered include: 
- Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA)
- logging, profiling and tracinG
- mission critical feature design
- fault-tolerant memory and storage 
- multi-core processing
- and asymmetric multi-processing methods for real-time design compared to RTOS and cyclic executive architectures.
